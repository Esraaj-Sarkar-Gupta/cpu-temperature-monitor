These files contain records of my CPU measurements using the python scripts while I was playing CS-GO.
The graph makes it very evident when the game boots up as the temperature immediately exceeds normal functioning conditions. 

The game stopped (crashed and had to be force quit) at a point, which is also visible from the red entries on the graph. 




I have a really bad GPU. This machine is NOT built for gaming.
